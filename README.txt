DevOps
======

At it's core, there are two primary goals for a good devops stack.

1. Rapidly bring up new infrastructure with consistency
2. Handle changes across service with reliability and repeability

To that end, this repository contains devops tasks for managing the servers
that I have to keep an eye on, mostly in my spare time, and to fulfill a 
personal need, like ownCloud or IRC bots.

The ansible portion of this repository is cribbed mostly from the fantastic
Sovereign ansible project that makes setting up a basic service very easy.
